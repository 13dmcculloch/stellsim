# stellsim - Modulation format simulator

A program that can modulate binary data to an array of complex double structs
to simulate or indeed implement modulation in software.

can: read - "will be able to"

While a toy dog compared to an ASIC, it is interesting to code a simulator for
this. There are libraries in Python and MATLAB that allow one to do something
similar, but I decided that it would be nice to try making this in C.

### Synopsis

Console under development.

### Commands

TBC

### Notes

Can add flags to makefile to vectorise math operations to use MMX, SSE.
